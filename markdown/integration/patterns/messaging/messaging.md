# Messaging Patterns in System Integration

## 1. Point-to-Point

In this messaging pattern, a message is sent from one system (producer) to another system (consumer). This is the simplest form of messaging pattern and is typically used when the producer knows exactly where the message needs to be sent.

## 2. Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub)

In this messaging pattern, the sender (publisher) does not need to know who the receivers (subscribers) are. The sender sends a message to a topic, and all subscribers who have expressed interest in this topic receive the message.

## 3. Request-Reply

This is a two-way messaging pattern where a system sends a request message and expects a reply message in return. This is used in scenarios where the sender requires confirmation or additional data from the receiver.

## 4. Router

In this pattern, a message is sent to a router that decides where to send the message based on rules or conditions. This is useful in scenarios where a message needs to be sent to different receivers based on its content or other factors.

## 5. Front-end Messaging

In this pattern, systems communicate via a messaging server or middleware. The middleware handles message queuing, routing, transformation, and provides a level of abstraction between the sender and receiver.

## 6. Message Channel

This pattern provides a way for systems to communicate using a channel. A message channel is a conduit where messages are passed, providing a coupling mechanism between systems.

## 7. Dead Letter Channel

This is a design pattern used in message-oriented middleware systems. When a message cannot be delivered or processed, it is sent to a 'dead letter' queue so that it can be investigated.

## 8. Return Address

This pattern is used in scenarios where a reply is expected to a message. The sender includes a return address in the message to which the reply should be sent.

## 9. Correlation Identifier

This pattern is used when a message is part of a conversation or a request-reply scenario. The sender assigns a unique identifier to the message which is returned with the reply message. This helps the sender correlate the reply with the original request.

## 10. Distributed Tracing

This pattern is used for troubleshooting and performance optimization in distributed systems. It provides a way to correlate work done in different systems on behalf of a single request by tracing the entire chain of calls.
