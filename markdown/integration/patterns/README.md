# System Integration Patterns
## 1. File Transfer

This is the simplest and most traditional way to integrate systems. One system writes data into a file, which another system then reads. File transfer is the easiest way to move data from one place to another, though it is not real-time.

## 2. Shared Database
With this pattern, two or more systems are integrated by having access to the same database. They can read and write to shared tables. While this is an easy way to integrate systems, it can lead to issues with data integrity and security if not managed properly.

## 3. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
In this pattern, one system exposes its functionality through a service interface, and the other system makes a function or procedure call to this interface, as if it was a local system call. This approach is synchronous and hence can block the calling application until the operation is complete.

## 4. Messaging
Messaging allows systems to integrate asynchronously by sending and receiving messages between them. This allows for greater scalability and reliability, as systems do not need to be up and running at the same time.

## 5. Publish/Subscribe
Also known as Pub/Sub, in this pattern, one system (the publisher) sends a message without knowing which system (the subscriber) will receive it. This allows for decoupling of systems and can handle high volumes of data and high throughput.

## 6. Data Replication
This pattern involves copying data from one database to another, so that the second database has a replica of the data in the first. This is often used for reporting, data warehousing, or backup purposes.

## 7. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
This is a design pattern in which services provide the communication method between components. Each service is a discrete unit of functionality and can be used in different combinations to achieve the required functionality.

## 8. RESTful APIs
Representational state transfer (REST) APIs are a popular way of integrating systems, especially for web services. They use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## 9. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
In EDA, a system produces an event when a significant change in its state occurs. Other systems subscribe to these events and react accordingly. This architecture enables real-time, asynchronous integrations.

## 10. Microservices Architecture
In this pattern, an application is designed as a group of loosely coupled services. Each service runs a unique process and communicates through well-defined APIs.

These patterns each have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use will depend on the specific use case, the systems being integrated, and the requirements for the integration. It is also common to use a mix of these patterns in the same integration architecture.
