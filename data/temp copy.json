The legs have an elasticated cuff that helps keep the fit secure and stops the legs from riding up. What's more, these are an alternative to the standard greys and blacks you usually find with joggers, letting you keep the casual style whilst being able to shake it up.Material Composition: Polyester 65% Cotton 35%\n",

    "description": "Courtesy of the Kem collection, these check suit trousers are certainly ticking all the sartorial boxes. Arriving in a rich navy blue colourway that’s marked by a subtle, barely-there all-over check motif, these trousers are perfect for injecting a touch of colour into your selection of smart ensembles. They’re cut to a tailored, straight leg silhouette with a mid-rise waist, concealed front fastening and belt loops. Side pockets are accompanied by jetted rear pockets for a functional touch and pressed creases define both legs for a nod to traditional sartorial cues. When coupled with a crisp white shirt, these trousers will easily take you from the boardroom to spur-of-the-moment fine dining. For an additional layer, why not pair them with the coordinating shacket?Kem\nKem\nMaterial Composition: Polyester 71% Viscose 21% Elastane 8%\nWARNING!

    "description": "It’s another sartorial slam dunk from the Kem range with this checked single-breasted suit jacket. And of course, we’d expect no less, so how about you get down to a store and see this beauty for yourself! Arriving in a rich, inky blue colourway, this navy blazer features a subtle all-over check pattern for an intriguing element that kicks the design up a notch or two, while it’s structured to a classic silhouette with peak lapels, long sleeves and single-breasted button fastenings. One welt pocket and two jetted pockets to the front offer a touch of functionality and to finalise the piece, a vent can be found at the back to aid easy movement and comfortable wear. Tailored trousers or chinos are a clear choice when you want a traditionally smart look, but don’t discount a pair of jeans if you require something a little less formal.Kem\nKem\nMaterial Composition: Polyester 71%  Viscose 21% Elastane 8%\nWARNING!

    "description": "What would we be without a classic tee? We’re musing over such a thought and choosing to ignore. An understated look, the backbone of casual attire - anyone who disagrees is probably just a liar. So, we’re always thrilled to add another to our collection, and this quarter zip textured T-shirt certainly has our affection. It’s made from a mixed cotton blend, which helps offer comfort to no end, while the textured design is just oh so fine. A round neck and silver-tone zip fastening feature to make this top the most wonderful creature, and finally, short sleeves and a straight hem catapults the style into a relaxed looking gem. Look at that, we’re a poet and we don’t even know it.Material Composition: Cotton 50%  Polyester 50%\n",
